{"html":"<h2>About Me</h2>\n<p>I’m a high school student living in Wisconsin as a foreign exchange student. My exchange program is until June 2022, and then I’m going back to Japan. I’m not planning to go to a college in the US, but planning to study abroad again during college.<br>\nI’ve been writing code for 2 years, and currently studying decentralized systems such as P2P network.<br>\nAs a web front-end developer, I mainly use Svelte to develop web apps and create websites meanwhile I use Next.js and Nuxt.js when team development since Svelte is not as popular as them (sadly…). This website is made with Svelte by the way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/golf.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h2>About My Blog</h2>\n<p>Although most of the contents are written in Japanese so far, I’m thinking of writing all posts in English during this exchange year. If you find something wrong in my posts, please let me know via Twitter, GitHub or email.</p>\n"}
